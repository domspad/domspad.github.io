I find the whole Lisp/Emacs journey a chicken and egg problem. 

You want to delve into the watery depths of functional programming and bask in the glow of ancient programming language gods? Try Lisp! Here let's set up your dev environment...da da da... HERE ARE A MILLION EMACS COMMANDS... da da da ... okay let's start Lisp!

You want to understand how to `C-x C-f M-y` your way out of a paper bag with Emacs? Well it's all written in Lisp, so maybe get your hands dirty with that and come back later.

Well, the time has come, and I just started a strict diet of chicken and eggs (come to think of it, I don't think I've ever eaten the two simultaneously). Here are some first impressions of my trek through Emacs with help from [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com).

1. This isn't [my first rodeo](/2016/06/30/form-is-freeing-or-how-to-live-without-a-mouse.html) with keyboard mastery, but I've regressed back to the days when I feel scared to enter commands not knowing what the next `C-x M-/ ...` will bring. Xkcd mentions the famous [`M-b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y`](https://xkcd.com/378/), and I'm afraid my next Meta command will be un-undo-able!

2. How the heck do keep track of what you have in your kill-yank stream?! Okay you can treat it like a clipboard with memory, but honestly when will you go that far down the stack?

3. `C-x ...` AND `M-x ...` are such unnatural keyboard strokes for me, even after swapping `CTRL` with `CAPS LOCK`. Emacs-ers must have gymnastic pinkies.

4. What do you mean "the buffer is still alive" when I kill the window it lived in? So much is going on behind the screen, that I just wanna crack

5. iwillnotcomplainaboutparentheses

6. Okay, `paredit-mode` I know your just trying to help, but is there a chill switch for you? I feel like you're always trying to finish my sentences.
