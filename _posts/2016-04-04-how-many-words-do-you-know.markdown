If you tried to build your vocabulary in a language just by reading books, how many books would you have to read to achieve the vocabulary of a native speaker?

Here is the key finding, which will be explained below in more detail

</div>

Some of the (personal) assumptions made in the analysis:

- To have 'learned' a word, you must see it at least <b>3</b> times.
- A 'book' is estimated to be roughly 50000 words == 200 pages of 25 lines each 10 words.
- The data used is from a series of books written by Hungarian author, Rejtő Jenő, of which at least 20 can be found [online](http://mek.oszk.hu/).

According to [one linguist](http://www.streetsmartlanguagelearning.com/2013/02/how-many-words-does-average-native.html) who has devoted his life to language learning, different levels of langague knowledge can be discerned by their vocab size. The table is summarized below:

Using these (very rough) estimates of vocabulary sizes, I have broken up the 20 books written by Hungarian author Rejtő Jenő into words, and start counting up the number of times each word is seen as I progress through the books in an arbitrary order. Once a word has been seen 3 times, I count it as a 'learned' word. The result of the number of books read vs number of words learned is the first graphic above. Surprisingly, even by the 20th book, you are still added quite a lot of new words to your vocabulary.

Further Questions

- What does this graphic look like for other authors? languages?
- What if you used news articles instead?
- Is 3 times per word a reasonable estimate for when a word enters our passive vocabulary?

Some Footnotes

- More than enough for even the most avid Rejtő Jenő fans.
- Often times when I'm reading I'll write down the translation of a word in the margin of the book. 3 is rough estimate of the number of times I have probably seen and processed a word once o really get it into at least your passive vocabulary.
- According to [Amazon](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/book-length_n_1334636.html - same as Brave new World)) 64,000 words is a reasonable estimate for median book length.
- This is not encouraged to be an adequate way of learning the language. It is a thought experiment I came up with since I live 1000's of miles away from the country whose language I'm learning
