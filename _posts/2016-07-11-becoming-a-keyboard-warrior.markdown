On the road to becoming a Keyboard warrior...


Having only recently taken to the computer as a my mind's central control station -- I've developed a lot of lazy and not well thought-out habits with my interaction with it.

One of the biggest being my reliance on the mouse. More generally, it's just a lack of critical thought about how I interact with the computer.

This has, of course, changed slowly over time...

- It started with learning the basic Apple CMD+Q, CMD+W windows and tabs shortcuts (and a [few others] that are useful to ANY Apple user)

- Then there came a sort of system manager like [Alfred], later becoming OSX's builtin [Spotlight], which has really improved over time.

- The process of coding itself forced me to think critically about typing -- I started using a text editor with keyboard bindings (Sublime Text), where I also begin to learn that CTRL+F isn't limited to just literal characters but could be biochemically enhanced with [Regex's]. If I only I knew them better... 

- The web was probably one of the last places I've found out how to better interact with. As [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/Mouseless-Computing) points out, it was more designed for mouse interaction (via clicking on hyperlinks). But there is ALWAYS a way. A quick and dirty solution was when I learned that CTRL+F could be used to find elements on a page to then navigate to (you can use it to find a button via it's text, then ESC, then ENTER to follow it).

- I'm now learning Emacs as it came recommended when picking up Lisp dialects.

Personally, I believe the more variety you see and try out the better -- try a new editor once. Try not touching your mouse for 15 minutes -- you'll find some interesting keyboard-only challenges you never would've thought of (and quickly realize the compicated network of application keyobard bindings vs system-wide keyboard bindings).

Finally, as you become better with more simple interactions with the computer (e.g. not using a mouse), you'll become more critical with all inefficient ways we never question, and also what tools you end up using. For me, this has meant simplification in my workflow. These can change overtime (maybe you'll try using CAPSLOCK for CTRL for awhile, to save your pinky), but its the process of modifying and trying a different mapping that will open up a new dimension of computer use for you -- and make you more comfortable no matter what computer you have to interact with.

even [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/going-commando-put-down-the-mouse/) thinks so!
