      A Relationship in Emails

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One of my closest friendships had its beginnings in nothing more than email exchange and an every-so-often skype meeting. This is quite surprising in my life because I'm actually pretty negligent when it comes to communicating via technology -- maybe I should have been born 50 years ago -- which is why I cherish our relationship even more so.</p>
<p>In fact, it extends back through hundreds of emails, so in this post, I wanted to attempt a visualization of it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/convo_tickplot.png" width="800"/></div>

<p>In a few easy steps that I'll outline below, you can take your email correspondence with someone and layout a timeline of of ticks representing individual emails. This particular way of visualizing was inspired by endless browsing of Edward Tufte's beautiful visualizations.</p>
<h2>Analysis of the Image</h2>
<p>If you squint your eyes, you can see some clusters which were periods where we were a bit more conversant. I see 3 in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>December '13 -- March '14</b> : When we first began corresponding. We were in different cities, and well, you can see how it was pretty dense until Christmas, we met in person, then they left again, where it began to pick up again early '14. In April '14 I went to visit them, which is why it slowed down again for a bit until Summer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Summer '14</b> : Before they came back, we again shared many emails. In July they took off again for long trip. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>September '14 - November '14</b>: This one is a curious one. This was the longest time we actually spent in the same city, yet we continued to pass emails back and forth. This is probably because at this time I admitted I was now moving back home (they had just moved to the city where I currently was). My departure date was in November. After which, we spent some time breathing from that intense period of emails and hangouts. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I played with different color schemes to see other aspects of the emails. For instance, I blue-red scheme represents emails that were replies to previous emails, and emails that were the first of a thread. My friend usually has a bit more to say than me, which is probably why most of my emails are 'replies'!</p>
<!-- ## Try it out

This whole process is as easy as 1-2-3, with a Gmail account and a bit of Python knowledge (the main Python libraries I'm using being `mailbox`, `dateutil`, and `matplotlib`). 

1 - Download all of your emails with Gmail's "Takeout" (for just correspondence with a particular person, I recommend just creating a new label for all those emails). They have a pretty straightforward process.

2 - You will have a `.mbox` file, this can be easily parsed into individual messages with Python's `mailbox` library.

3 - 

After downloading all of our emails with Gmail's "Takeout" (for just correspondence with a particular person, I recommend just creating a new label for all those emails), I immediately began playing with emails in Python


Look at all those pretty bars
