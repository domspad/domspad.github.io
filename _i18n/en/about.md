What do I offer?

Professional (and native) quality English translations from both Hungarian and Italian (see 'My Services' for details). 

What is my background?



Writing has always been a central part of my professional life -- as far back as my undergraduate studies, two years of which I worked on and ran an academic research journal in finance, economics, and marketing at the University of Michigan. After shifting my sights towards philosophy and mathematics, I proceeded to present papers and research at conferences in both fields over the following few years. After being all set up to pursue a life in academia and the sciences, I came to Hungary for a study-abroad program, ultimately realizing that language was where my future lied.

Alongside living and working as a programmer, I began to imbibe the language over the course of 5 years, ultimately earning the highest recognized fluency accreditation in Hungarian (C1) in 2017. It was at this point I decided to take the plunge into translation fully after seeing the opportunity to open up the world to English-speakers through the eye's of a native.

Since beginning my career, the texts I have translated have come from well beyond the scope of fields I have studied in, although I still have a sweet spot for technical work.
